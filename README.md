# Japanese Vocabulary Application

This application is a beta version Japanese vocabulary card application. Create vocabulary cards targeted for N2 study.

Used to practice my vanilla JavaScript. Built with JS, using Webpack, HTTP-Server, and JSON-Server to mock up a JSON for flashcard entities and user.

Purely just to brush up. Maybe in the future, can become a tangible app... but would require quite a large amount of upkeep.

# Japanese Vocabulary Application

This application is a beta version Japanese vocabulary card application. Create vocabulary cards targeted for N2 study.

Used to practice my vanilla JavaScript. Built with JS, using Webpack, HTTP-Server, and JSON-Server to mock up a JSON for flashcard entities and user.

Purely just to brush up. Maybe in the future, can become a tangible app... but would require quite a large amount of upkeep. 

## To Start 

In the root directory, make sure to run 
- `npm run start` to trigger the HTTP server and webpack watch to recompile on changes, and  
- `npm run server` to trigger the JSON server to mock REST calls to localhost:4000, which is a lite db based on db.json at room
